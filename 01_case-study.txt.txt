And I also communicate with R&D to stay transparent with them. I'd also prioritize the critical task, encourage collaboration, and ensure the team has the resources they need, recognizing their extra efforts along the way.

3. What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?
Answer:

	This could have easily been prevented had the manager and developer only followed a few basic common-sense practices ahead of time. The manager may ensure that team members are cross-trained in each other's work, allowing them to step out if necessary. Clear logs will keep others up to speed on the project should it be necessary for them to quickly catch up. They would often sit together as a team and regularly meet to discuss what may be coming their way — whether that be personal stuff or work issues-the weekend after. On the developer’s side, keeping their work well-documented and being open about any upcoming personal responsibilities can help the team stay prepared. By focusing on teamwork, communication, and planning, everyone can help keep the project running smoothly, even if surprises come up.
